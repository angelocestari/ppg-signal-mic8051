# Heart Rate Monitor with PPG

This project implements a heart rate monitor using a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor. The system reads data from the PPG sensor, processes it, and displays the heart rate on a GLCD. The buzzer can be controlled via buttons to provide audible feedback, and the system includes debounce functionality to ensure accurate button presses.
